title: OpenVox History
---

OpenVox is the modern open source implementation of the world's most capable configuration management platform -- trusted by everyone from the smallest hobbyist to operators of some of the largest commercial infrastructures in the business.

OpenVox started life as a Puppet&trade; mirror by [Overlook InfraTech](https://overlookinfratech.com/) to continue providing community packages when Perforce discontinued public packaging efforts in late Fall of 2024.
It soon became clear that they were also moving all further Puppet development to internal forks and ceasing development on open source Puppet.
A community effort to preserve open-source Puppet development, using Overlook InfraTech's packaging pipeline, was the inevitable response.

We consider OpenVox to be the true continuation of the open-source Puppet Project.
To maintain compatibility with Perforce's Puppet Core, we created a **Puppet Standards Steering Committee** to set the direction of features and language evolutions and have invited Perforce to participate.
